#Practical Python for Django
Welcome to Django, and in this case, perhaps Python as well! Before jumping straight
into Django, we give you an in-depth overview of the language that is the foundation of
the Django applications you will develop. Programming experience with another highlevel
language (C/C++, Java, Perl, Ruby, and so forth) makes it easier to absorb the material
in this chapter.

However, if you have never programmed before, Python itself is a great first language,
and several books out there teach you how to program using Python.Those references are
provided at the end of this chapter.We recommend those new to programming check out
some of those resources; once you’ve gotten your feet wet, return here, and then you’ll
get more out of the following sections.

We introduce you to Python in this chapter, focusing on the core features of the language
and specific skills related to Django development.To develop effectively in Django,
not only do you need basic Python skills, but you need to know a bit more about how
Python works under the covers so when you come across certain features, aspects, or
requirements of Django, you won’t be left high and dry.Those new to Python or to programming
in general can benefit from reading other general Python material first or following
such materials along with this chapter—whichever suits your learning style best.

##Python Skills Are Django Skills
Django provides a high-level framework that enables you to build Web applications with
relatively few lines of code. It is simple, robust, and flexible, allowing you to design solutions
without much overhead. Django was built using Python, an object-oriented applications
development language which combines the power of systems languages, such as
C/C++ and Java, with the ease and rapid development of scripting languages, such as
Ruby and Visual Basic.This gives its users the ability to create applications that solve
many different types of problems.

In this chapter, we show you what we believe are some of the necessary Python skills
you should have to be an effective Django developer. Rather than regurgitating a generic
Python tutorial, we focus on those concepts of Python which are “must-haves” for the
Django developer. In fact, you find Django code scattered throughout the chapter.
